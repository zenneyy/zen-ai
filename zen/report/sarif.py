"""SARIF 2.1.0 output for Zen vulnerability reports.

Builds a GitHub code-scanning compatible SARIF document from Zen findings
so CI pipelines can upload findings via ``github/codeql-action/upload-sarif``,
ingest into ASPM platforms, or normalise across scanners.

Schema: SARIF 2.1.0 (OASIS). The output is validated against the official
schema at https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json in tests.

Integration:
  - ``ReportState._save_artifacts`` calls :func:`write_sarif` to emit a
    ``findings.sarif`` sidecar alongside the existing CSV + markdown + JSON
    artefacts on every save. The call is wrapped in try/except there so a
    SARIF failure never blocks the CSV + markdown + run-record path.

Design notes:
  * Rules are keyed on CWE (``id = CWE-NNN``), falling back to CVE, then
    to finding-id, then to a title slug. CWE values are normalised from
    Zen output variants (``CWE-306``, ``cwe: 306``, ``306``) to the
    canonical ``CWE-NNN`` form so dedup works across runs.
  * SARIF only has three levels (error / warning / note). Zen's five
    severities collapse into them. The raw severity label and CVSS score
    survive in ``result.properties.zen`` for downstream tools that can
    distinguish CRITICAL vs HIGH.
  * GitHub code-scanning uses ``rule.properties['security-severity']``
    (a 0.0-10.0 string) to rank alerts. We populate it from CVSS when
    available, otherwise from a conservative label -> score map.
  * File locations must be repo-relative POSIX paths. Paths that look
    like URIs, absolute paths, or traversal patterns are rejected rather
    than emitted as invalid code-scanning alerts.
  * Findings with a fix suggestion (``code_locations[].fix_before`` +
    ``fix_after``) are emitted as SARIF ``fixes`` so code-scanning can
    render a one-click suggested change.
  * Endpoint / target-only findings (typical of DAST) carry a SARIF
    ``logicalLocations`` entry so the finding keeps a meaningful anchor
    even without a source file + line.
  * When a repository context is supplied (repo URL / commit / branch),
    the run carries ``versionControlProvenance`` + ``automationDetails``
    so code-scanning can bind alerts to the scanned commit and branch.
  * Findings without safe locations still appear in the SARIF output,
    anchored to SECURITY.md and flagged via
    ``properties.synthetic_location`` rather than being dropped silently.
  * Coverage rides in the same document as non-failing results (``kind`` of
    ``pass`` / ``notApplicable`` / ``open``), and run completeness on
    ``run.invocations``. Consumers that only want alerts filter on
    ``kind == "fail"`` and are unaffected.
