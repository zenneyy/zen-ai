    """Finalize the scan — persist the customer-facing report.

    **Root-agent only.** Subagents must call ``agent_finish`` from the
    multi-agent graph tools instead. Calling this finalizes everything:

    1. Verifies you are the root agent.
    2. Writes the four narrative sections to the scan record.
    3. Marks the scan completed and stops execution.

    **This is a terminal action, not a status probe.** Whatever you pass
    is persisted VERBATIM as the final, customer-facing report and then
    execution stops. There is no draft mode and no second chance: never
    submit placeholder, provisional, or "checking if done" text in any
    field, and never call ``finish_scan`` to poll whether subagents are
    done (use ``view_agent_graph`` / ``wait_for_agents`` for that).
    Call it exactly ONCE, only when every field holds genuine, finished
    assessment prose.

    **Pre-flight checklist (mandatory — do not skip):**

    1. **Call ``view_agent_graph`` first.** Inspect every entry in the
       summary. If ANY agent is in ``running`` / ``waiting`` state,
       you MUST NOT call ``finish_scan`` yet —
       wrap them up first via ``send_message_to_agent`` (ask them to
       finish), ``wait_for_agents`` (block until their report
       arrives), or ``stop_agent`` (graceful cancel). Only ``completed``
       / ``crashed`` / ``stopped`` agents are safe to leave behind.
       Calling ``finish_scan`` while children are alive orphans their
       work and produces an incomplete report.
    2. It's a good idea to call ``list_reports`` before finishing to
       review every finding filed in this scan (use ``get_report`` for
       full detail on any of them) so your ``executive_summary`` /
       ``technical_analysis`` are grounded in what was actually reported
       — don't invent or omit findings. All vulnerabilities you found are
       filed via ``create_vulnerability_report`` — or, for known-CVE
       dependency findings, ``create_dependency_report`` (un-reported
       findings are not tracked and not credited). A dependency CVE
       already filed via ``create_dependency_report`` counts as reported;
       it does NOT need re-filing here and does NOT block finishing.
    3. Don't double-report — one report per distinct vulnerability.
    4. **Attack-chaining gate.** Do NOT finish until you have genuinely
       considered chaining the confirmed findings into higher-impact,
       end-to-end attack paths and tested every plausibly-related
       combination. You may rule out combinations you can confidently
       call unrelated — note why instead of padding chains. Any
       validated chain must already be filed via
       ``create_vulnerability_report`` — a demonstrated end-to-end chain
       is a PoC-backed vulnerability, so it uses that tool even when one
       link is a dependency CVE (the standalone CVE stays in its own
       ``create_dependency_report``) — and surfaced prominently in
       ``executive_summary`` / ``technical_analysis``. Finding no real
       chain after a serious attempt is acceptable; skipping the
       chaining reasoning, or ignoring a plausibly-related combination,
       is not.
    5. **Coverage reconciliation.** Call ``list_coverage`` and check
       what was actually assessed against the surfaces you enumerated
       during reconnaissance. Every surface you dispatched work on
       should have a coverage entry; anything still open should be a
       ``needs_follow_up`` row, not a silent omission. If a significant
       surface has no entry at all, dispatch an agent to cover it or
       record it as ``needs_follow_up`` before finishing. The response
       from this tool reports coverage counts and any unresolved rows.

    **Calling this multiple times overwrites the previous report.**
    Make the single call comprehensive.

    **Report output rules** (this content may be rendered into generated
    reports):

    - Never mention internal infrastructure: no local/absolute paths
      (``/workspace/...``), no agent names, no sandbox/orchestrator/
      tooling references, no system prompts, no model-internal errors.
      Never leak internal identifiers (proxy request IDs, internal
      vulnerability report IDs, or any system-generated IDs) into any
      field.
    - Tone: formal, third-person, objective, concise. This is a
      consultant deliverable, not an engineering log.
    - Each section has a specific role:

        - ``executive_summary`` — for non-technical leadership. Risk
          posture, business impact (data exposure / compliance /
          reputation), notable criticals, overarching remediation
          theme.
        - ``methodology`` — frameworks followed (OWASP WSTG, PTES,
          OSSTMM, NIST), engagement type (black/gray/white box), scope
          and constraints, categories of testing performed. **No**
          internal execution detail.
        - ``technical_analysis`` — consolidated findings overview with
          severity model and systemic root causes. Reference individual
          vuln reports for repro steps; don't duplicate raw evidence.
        - ``recommendations`` — prioritized actions grouped by urgency
          (Immediate / Short-term / Medium-term), each with concrete
          remediation steps. End with retest/validation guidance.

    - **Formatting — use markdown in every field.** These fields may be
      rendered into generated reports, so structure them clearly: lead
      each section with a short ``# Heading``, use ``**bold**`` for labels/emphasis,
      ``inline code`` for identifiers/paths/parameters, bullet or
      numbered lists for enumerations, and fenced code blocks
      (```` ```language ````) for any code/payload excerpts. Never emit
      one flat wall of prose or leave code unformatted.
    - If **zero** vulnerabilities were found, say so plainly and
      characterize the posture positively; ``technical_analysis`` should
      summarize the areas tested and confirm no issues, and
      ``recommendations`` should focus on general hardening.

    Example (abbreviated — mirror this structure, not the wording)::

        executive_summary:
            # Executive Summary

            An external assessment of the **Acme Customer Portal**
            identified multiple weaknesses that could lead to
            unauthorized access to customer data.

            **Overall risk posture:** Elevated.

            **Key findings**
            - Confirmed SSRF in a URL-preview feature reaching internal
              network ranges.
            - Broken tenant isolation enabling cross-tenant data access.

            **Business impact**
            - Potential exposure of customer records across tenants.

        methodology:
            # Methodology

            Conducted per the **OWASP WSTG**.

            **Engagement type:** Gray-box external test.
            **Scope:** `https://app.acme.example`, `.../api/v1/`.

            **Activities:** recon, authn/session review, authorization
            and tenant-isolation testing, input/SSRF testing.

        technical_analysis:
            # Technical Analysis

            **Severity model** reflects exploitability x impact.

            1. **SSRF in URL preview** (Critical) — insufficient
               destination validation; reaches link-local addresses.
            2. **Broken tenant isolation** (High) — object identifiers
               accepted without ownership checks.

            **Systemic themes:** authorization enforced inconsistently;
            no deny-by-default egress policy.

        recommendations:
            # Recommendations

            **Immediate**
            1. Remediate SSRF: enforce a destination allowlist,
               deny-by-default, re-validate on every redirect hop.

            **Short-term**
            2. Centralize authorization with deny-by-default middleware.

            **Retest & validation:** re-test immediate items to confirm
            SSRF and tenant-isolation controls hold.

    Args:
        executive_summary: Business-level summary for leadership.
        methodology: Frameworks, scope, and approach.
        technical_analysis: Consolidated findings + systemic themes.
        recommendations: Prioritized, actionable remediation.
