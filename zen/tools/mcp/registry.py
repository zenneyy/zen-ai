"""Per-run registry of the MCP connections a scan may reach.

Replaces per-tool registration. The old model turned every tool of every
connected MCP server into its own agent tool, so a run with a handful of
connections put dozens of provider tool schemas on the root agent's first LLM
request. Instead, a run holds its live connections here, keyed by the name the
user gave each connection, and every agent reaches them through three generic
dispatch tools: ``list_mcps`` to discover the available connections, ``describe_mcp``
to learn one connection's tool schemas on demand, and ``call_mcp`` to run one of
its tools.

One :class:`McpRegistry` is built per run in :mod:`zen.core.runner`, stored in
the run context under :data:`MCP_REGISTRY_CONTEXT_KEY`, and shared by the root
agent and every child (the child context is a copy of the parent's, so it
carries the same registry object).

zen-pro imports :class:`McpRegistry` to add its cloud connections into the
same registry and to attach a per-connection ``result_transform`` (its
sanitizer), which :func:`zen.tools.mcp.client.dispatch_mcp_call` applies at the
single dispatch point.
