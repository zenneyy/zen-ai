"""The three generic MCP dispatch tools every agent carries.

Under the generic-dispatch model an agent does not get one tool per MCP tool.
It gets exactly these three and discovers connections on demand:

- ``list_mcps()`` returns the connections available this run — each connection's
  id, name, description, and tool count, with no tool schemas — so the model can
  discover what it can reach without any inventory in the system prompt.
- ``describe_mcp(connection)`` returns, as text, one connection's tools with
  their names, descriptions, and JSON input schemas — the schemas the model
  needs, fetched on demand instead of loaded onto every request up front.
- ``call_mcp(connection, tool, arguments)`` dispatches one call to a
  connection's tool and returns its result.

All three read the per-run :class:`~zen.tools.mcp.registry.McpRegistry` from the
run context under :data:`~zen.tools.mcp.registry.MCP_REGISTRY_CONTEXT_KEY`. They
are ordinary ``FunctionTool`` objects placed in the agent factory's base tool set,
so the factory's output-bounding and disk-spill wrapping apply to their results
automatically.
