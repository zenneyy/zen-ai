"""Own each MCP connection's live session on its own supervising task.

The bug this fixes: the streamable-HTTP transport (the ``mcp`` SDK) opens an
internal anyio task group when ``server.connect()`` runs, and that task group's
cancel scope is entered on whatever task called ``connect()`` and stays open for
the session's whole life. In the old code that task was the run's main task, the
one the agent loop runs on. So when a provider returned an HTTP error on one of
the transport's background tasks (for example a ``403`` on a background POST),
the task group cancelled its scope, the cancellation
propagated to the main task, and the whole scan died with a bare
``CancelledError`` (mislabeled as a user interrupt). Teardown then raised
"Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task than it was entered in"
because cleanup ran on a different task than connect.

The fix, mirroring how child agents run on their own ``asyncio.create_task``
(see :func:`zen.core.execution.spawn_child_agent`): give each connection its
own dedicated supervising task that owns ``connect()``, the session's held-open
lifetime, and ``cleanup()``. Three consequences:

- **Containment.** The transport's cancel scope is now entered on the supervising
  task, so a background failure cancels only that task. The run and every other
  connection keep going.
- **Co-located teardown.** ``connect()`` and ``cleanup()`` run on the same task,
  so the "exit cancel scope in a different task" error cannot happen.
- **A value, not a cancellation, reaches the caller.** The agent never touches the
  live session directly. It hands a call to the supervising task over a queue and
  awaits the result as a value; if the session task dies, the caller gets a
  "connection unavailable" value instead of a cancellation propagating into the
  agent loop.

When a call fails the supervisor rebuilds and reconnects the session once (reusing
the same config, so the same bearer token, never re-fetching credentials) and
re-runs the one failed call once. If that still fails, the connection is marked
dead: every later call returns the standard failed-tool output.

Security: the connection's :class:`~zen.tools.mcp.config.McpConnectionConfig`
holds a live bearer credential and is kept here in memory only, on the same
in-process object that already holds the live session. It is never logged,
serialized into the run's event stream, or written to disk; :meth:`__repr__`
omits it and the token field's own ``repr`` is already suppressed.
