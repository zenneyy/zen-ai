"""Own each MCP connection's live session on its own supervising task.

The bug this fixes: the streamable-HTTP transport (the ``mcp`` SDK) opens an
internal anyio task group when ``server.connect()`` runs, and that task group's
cancel scope is entered on whatever task called ``connect()`` and stays open for
the session's whole life. In the old code that task was the run's main task, the
one the agent loop runs on. So when a provider returned an HTTP error on one of
the transport's background tasks (for example a ``403`` on a background POST),
the task group cancelled its scope, the cancellation
propagated to the main task, and the whole scan died with a bare
``CancelledError`` (mislabeled as a user interrupt). Teardown then raised
"Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task than it was entered in"
because cleanup ran on a different task than connect.

The fix, mirroring how child agents run on their own ``asyncio.create_task``
(see :func:`zen.core.execution.spawn_child_agent`): give each connection its
own dedicated supervising task that owns ``connect()``, the session's held-open
lifetime, and ``cleanup()``. Three consequences:

- **Containment.** The transport's cancel scope is now entered on the supervising
  task, so a background failure cancels only that task. The run and every other
  connection keep going.
- **Co-located teardown.** ``connect()`` and ``cleanup()`` run on the same task,
  so the "exit cancel scope in a different task" error cannot happen.
- **A value, not a cancellation, reaches the caller.** The agent never touches the
  live session directly. It hands a call to the supervising task over a queue and
  awaits the result as a value; if the session task dies, the caller gets a
  "connection unavailable" value instead of a cancellation propagating into the
  agent loop.

Failure handling follows connection-pool discipline: discard on error, rebuild on
next use. A failure while connecting or rebuilding describes the session. A
non-2xx response from a tool call describes that request, not the session. Permission
and protocol failures from a call return a failed tool output while the connection
stays usable. Other classified failures are retried on the rebuilt session and then,
if they keep failing, temporarily quarantine the connection. Authentication failures
and repeated transient exhaustion permanently retire a connection.

Security: the connection's :class:`~zen.tools.mcp.config.McpConnectionConfig`
holds a live bearer credential and is kept here in memory only, on the same
in-process object that already holds the live session. It is never logged,
serialized into the run's event stream, or written to disk; :meth:`__repr__`
omits it and the token field's own ``repr`` is already suppressed.

        healthy.** The moment a call fails, the very next thing this method does,
        before any other ``await`` including the backoff sleep inside
        :meth:`_handle_failure`, is dispose that session on this task
        (:meth:`_safe_cleanup` runs the transport teardown and clears ``_server``).

        Why the ordering is the crux, not a nicety: when a provider returns a non-2xx
        status mid-call, the streamable-HTTP transport's task group cancels its scope,
        which cancels this supervising task; the failure surfaces as a
        ``CancelledError`` and the scope keeps firing (re-raising on every subsequent
        ``await``) until the session is torn down. Disposing closes the transport's
        AsyncExitStack, which exits that firing scope. If instead we slept for backoff
        first, the sleep would re-raise the firing ``CancelledError``, escape this
        method, and kill the supervising task, leaving the slot wedged with
        ``is_dead`` False forever. Disposing first is what turns a failure into a
        returned value and keeps the task alive to rebuild on the next attempt.

        The rebuild itself happens lazily at the top of the loop: once a failure has
        set ``_server`` to None, the next iteration builds a fresh session (guarded by
        :meth:`_reconnect`) and retries the operation on it. A permission or protocol
        failure from a call returns immediately after disposal because it describes
        that request, not the session. A genuine shutdown (``_closing``) and a real
        external cancellation still propagate; only the transport's teardown
        cancellation is contained.

        got a non-2xx status the SDK cancelled that scope, and until the scope is
        exited every ``await`` on this task re-raises ``CancelledError``.
        ``server.cleanup()`` closes the AsyncExitStack that runs the task group's

        the firing; it also absorbs the scope's own cancellation internally, so the

        closing again continues from where it left off (the stack pops one callback at
