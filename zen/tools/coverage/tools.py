"""Per-run coverage ledger — mirrored to {state_dir}/coverage.json.

Findings answer "what did we find". Coverage answers "what did we look at,
and how did each one close" — the negative space a client report needs in
order to be trustworthy. Every agent records the surfaces it reviewed; the
root agent reconciles them at the end of the scan.

Entries here are **agent-reported**: an agent's own account of what it
assessed. ``zen.report.coverage`` pairs them with machine-observed facts
(which agents ran, which skills they carried, how the run terminated) and
labels the provenance of each, so a reader can tell a self-report from an
observation. The runtime mirror under ``{state_dir}`` exists for resume; the
client-facing artifact is ``{run_dir}/coverage.json``.

    A scan that only reports findings cannot answer the question every
    client asks: *what did you actually check?* This tool captures that
    negative space. Record an entry whenever you finish assessing a
    surface for a risk — including (especially including) when you found
    nothing.

    Record coverage as you go, not in a batch at the end. Entries are
    shared across every agent in the scan, and the root agent reconciles
    them into the final report.

    Coverage is not append-only bookkeeping: if this surface and risk
    already have an entry — yours or another agent's — this call is
    rejected and returns that entry's id, because two rows for one
    surface leave the report showing a stale conclusion next to its
    replacement. Call ``update_coverage`` on the id it hands you
    instead. Resolving somebody else's ``needs_follow_up`` is exactly
    that case.

    **Outcomes** (pick exactly one):

    - ``reported`` — you confirmed an issue and filed a report for it.
    - ``no_issue_found`` — you tested this properly and found nothing.
    - ``ruled_out`` — you had a specific candidate and disproved it. The
      ``evidence`` must name the control that makes it safe, at a
      location, and confirm it runs on every attacker-reachable path.
      "It looked fine" is not ``ruled_out``.
    - ``not_applicable`` — this risk cannot apply here (e.g. no XML
      parsing on a surface, so no XXE). Say why in ``evidence``.
    - ``needs_follow_up`` — plausible but unresolved: you could not
      confirm it and could not name a control that rules it out. This is
      a legitimate outcome. Use it rather than quietly dropping a
      candidate, and name the gap in ``evidence`` (missing credentials,
      service you could not start, unconfirmed reachability).

    Never use ``no_issue_found`` or ``ruled_out`` to close something you
    were simply unsure about — that is ``needs_follow_up``. Missing
    information is not proof of safety.

    Args:
        surface: What you reviewed — an endpoint, route, parameter,
            file, component, or host (e.g. ``"POST /api/orders/{id}"``,
            ``"src/auth/session.py"``, ``"admin dashboard"``).
        risk_area: What you were testing it for (e.g. ``"IDOR /
            object-level authorization"``, ``"SQL injection"``,
            ``"SSRF"``).
        outcome: One of ``reported`` / ``no_issue_found`` /
            ``ruled_out`` / ``not_applicable`` / ``needs_follow_up``.
        evidence: How you know. Required for ``ruled_out``,
