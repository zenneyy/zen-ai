"""Run-scoped threat models — mirrored to ``{state_dir}/threat_models.json``.

A threat model is the scan's shared answer to who the attacker is, where the
trust boundaries sit, and what counts as critical for the target. One agent
derives it and every other agent on the same run reads it back instead of
re-deriving trust boundaries from scratch.

It does not outlive the scan. The mirror lives in the run's own state directory
and exists only so a resumed scan keeps the baseline its earlier agents agreed
on; a new scan against the same host or checkout starts with no model and
derives its own. Agents do spell one target several ways within a run — the URL
they were handed, the page they happen to be testing, a checkout path — so a
model is keyed by a normalized target identity to keep them converging on one
document instead of each starting a fresh one.

    necessarily provisional — say which parts are inferred rather than
    observed, and let later agents amend it as the picture fills in.

    **Scope it to the target, not to your slice of it.** Do not centre
    it on the diff you were handed, the subsystem you were assigned, or
    the one host that happened to answer first. With source, distinguish
    real product and runtime surfaces from test, docs, example, and
    developer-tooling paths — in a monorepo, do not let ``tests/`` or
    one-off scripts become the centre of gravity unless the code shows
    they are genuinely deployed. Where the target documents its own
    boundary — an ``AGENTS`` file, a specific ``SECURITY.md``, a
    published API spec, an engagement scope — build on it rather than
    inventing a competing story.

    Structure the content in Markdown with these sections:

    - **Overview** — what the target actually is, its real-world usage,
      and which parts are product/runtime versus tooling or
      non-production.
    - **Trust Boundaries and Assumptions** — the boundaries, the actors
      on either side, and the invariants that must hold. Separate
      attacker-controlled, operator-controlled, and
      developer-controlled inputs explicitly. Black-box, this is the
      role, tenant, and privilege model: who can reach what before
      authenticating, as a low-privilege user, and across tenants.
    - **Attack Surface and Attacker Stories** — the exposed surfaces
      (hosts, endpoints, parameters, integrations, or the code-level
      entrypoints and sinks), the mitigations already present that
      materially change severity or reach, realistic attacker stories,
      and the stories that are *not* realistic here and why.
    - **Severity Calibration** — what critical / high / medium / low
      look like for *this* target, with a concrete example at each
      level. Where a vulnerability class needs attacker control that
      does not exist in real usage, say so here.

            pointed at.

    """Correct or extend the existing threat model without replacing it.

    The baseline is written before anyone starts hunting, so it is
    written with the least information anyone will ever have. That is
    doubly true black-box, where the model starts as inference over
    recon output and only becomes real as agents authenticate, map
    roles, and reach the surfaces behind them. When your work
    contradicts the model or fills in something it missed, record that
    here — every agent that calls ``get_threat_model`` afterwards sees
    your addendum next to the base model.

    Amendments are append-only and attributed, so two agents amending
    at once both survive. That is the difference from
    ``save_threat_model``, which overwrites the document and drops
    every amendment on it.

    Worth amending:

    - A boundary the model calls trusted that you found is
      attacker-reachable, or vice versa.
    - A host, endpoint, parameter, role, sink, or shared control the
      model does not mention.
    - Something the model only inferred that you have now observed — or
      that turned out not to be true.
    - A severity call the model got wrong for this target, with the
      reason.
    - An assumption you disproved — the model says input is validated
      upstream and you found the path that skips it.

    Not worth amending: individual findings (those are reports), or
    restating what the model already says.

    Args:
        target: What the model describes — the same host, URL, or
            repository path used to save it.
        addendum: The correction, in Markdown. State what the base
            model says, what is actually true, and the endpoint, host,
            file, or control that proves it.
