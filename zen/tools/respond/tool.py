    """Answer the user and hand control back to them.

    This is the ONLY way to yield to the user. Delivering the message and
    yielding are the same call on purpose: there is no way to answer and
    then forget to stop, and no way to stop without having answered.

    Call it when you have something for the user and nothing to do until
    they reply — you answered their question, you need a decision or a
    credential only they can give, or you finished a chunk of work and
    want direction. You resume exactly where you left off when they
    reply, with everything you have done so far intact.

    Do NOT call it to narrate progress or to think out loud. Plain text
    is still shown to the user as you work, so say whatever you like
    mid-task without stopping; ``respond_to_user`` is specifically the
    act of *waiting* for them. Every call costs the user their attention.

    Not for these:

    - **Waiting on another agent** (a child's report, a peer's reply) —
      use ``wait_for_agents``.
    - **Ending the engagement** — use ``finish_scan`` (root) or
      ``agent_finish`` (subagent). Those are terminal; this is a pause.

    Args:
        message: What to say to the user. Self-contained: they may not
            have followed the tool calls that led here. Lead with the
            answer or the decision you need, and if you are blocked, say
            exactly what you need from them.

            Omit it when you have just said your piece as plain text and
            only need to wait: that text has already reached them, and
            repeating it makes them read the same answer twice.
