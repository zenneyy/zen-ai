### Overview

To help make Zen better for everyone, we collect anonymized data that helps us understand how to better improve our AI security agent for our users, guide the addition of new features, and fix common errors and bugs. This feedback loop is crucial for improving Zen's capabilities and user experience.

We use [PostHog](https://posthog.com), an open-source analytics platform, for data collection and analysis, along with [Scarf](https://scarf.sh). Our telemetry implementation is fully transparent - you can review the source code ([posthog.py](https://github.com/zenneyy/zen-ai/blob/main/zen/telemetry/posthog.py), [scarf.py](https://github.com/zenneyy/zen-ai/blob/main/zen/telemetry/scarf.py)) to see exactly what we track.

### Telemetry Policy

Privacy is our priority. All collected data is anonymized by default. Each session gets a random UUID that is not persisted or tied to you. Your code, scan targets, vulnerability details, and findings always remain private and are never collected.

### What We Track

We collect only very **basic** usage data including:

**Session Errors:** Duration, the failure category, the scan phase, and the exception class name (not messages or stack traces)\
**System Context:** OS type, architecture, Zen version\
**Scan Context:** Scan mode (quick/standard/deep), scan type (whitebox/blackbox)\
**Model Usage:** Which LLM model is being used and whether it runs via an API key or a model subscription (not prompts or responses)\
**Feature Usage:** Which built-in skills were used during a scan (reported once, at scan end)\
**Aggregate Metrics:** Vulnerability counts by severity and weakness category (CWE)

### What We **Never** Collect

- Usernames, or any identifying information
- Scan targets, file paths, target URLs, or domains
- Vulnerability details, descriptions, or code
- LLM requests and responses

### How to Opt Out

Telemetry in Zen is entirely **optional**:

```bash
export ZEN_TELEMETRY=0
```

You can set this environment variable before running Zen to disable **all** telemetry.
