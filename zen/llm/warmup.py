"""Background pre-import of the heavy scan dependencies.

The scan engine's import graph (the agents SDK, OpenAI client, LiteLLM, the
Caido SDK, the Docker SDK) costs seconds to import cold, but none of it is
needed until a scan actually starts. Importing it on a daemon thread at CLI
entry overlaps that cost with the I/O-bound startup work that always precedes
a scan (argument parsing, Docker checks, image pull, TUI setup), so by the
time the scan begins the modules are already in ``sys.modules``. Any thread
that needs one of them before the warm-up finishes just blocks on the normal
import lock, so behaviour is unchanged either way.
