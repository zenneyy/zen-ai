"""Background pre-import of the heavy scan dependencies.

The scan engine's import graph (the agents SDK, OpenAI client, LiteLLM, the
Caido SDK) costs seconds to import cold, but none of it is needed until a scan
actually starts. Importing it on a daemon thread at CLI entry overlaps that
cost with the I/O-bound startup work that always precedes a scan (argument
parsing, Docker checks, image pull, TUI setup). The Docker SDK is not on the
list: the Docker checks import it on the main thread during that same window.

The main thread must call :func:`wait_for_import_warmup` before its first
import from that graph. Two threads that enter the same package graph from
different modules hold each other's import locks, and CPython breaks the cycle
by failing one of the imports.
